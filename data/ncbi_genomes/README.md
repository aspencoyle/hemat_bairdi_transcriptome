## amoebo_seqs.fna

FASTA file of _Amoebophrya sp._ genome. Downloaded on 2021-03-02. [A link to the genome page can be found here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=txid88551[Organism:noexp]), and a link to the GenBank entry found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/RXOD00000000.1)

Genome was sequenced as part of John et al. 2019 "An aerobic eukaryotic parasite with functional mitochondria that likely lacks a mitochondrial genome". _Science Advances_ 24;5(4) doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aav1110 

Genome was downloaded since at time of writing it is the most closely-related available genome to _Hematodinium sp._

## opilio_seqs.faa

FASTA file of _Chionoecetes opilio_ protein sequences. Downloaded on 2021-03-02. [A link to the genome page can be found here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=txid41210[Organism:exp]), and a link to the GenBank entry is [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/1953690421)

Genome was sequenced as part of Jeong, J.-H and Ryu, S. "The high-quality genome of the commercially important snow crab, Chionoecetes opilio" (submitted to Seoul National University, unpub.)

Genome was chosen since at time of writing it is currently the most closely-related genome to _Chionoecetes bairdi_.
